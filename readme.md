<h1><b>Spending API</b></h1>

<p>A backend API and website that I use to track all my spending.</p>

<p>It gives you the ability to create Recurring Budgets, then log
various Transactions (income and expenses) linked with one or more Budgets.</p>

<p>It also allows you to simulate your future balance state by creating income or expenses that recur every x days. 
So you have a better Idea of how much flexibility you have with your spending today.</p>
